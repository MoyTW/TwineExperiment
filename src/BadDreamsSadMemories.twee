You don't see Betty and Lawrence much, not since you moved out. They come to the family Thanksgiving and Christmas parties sometimes, but they skip them just as often. You know Mom still talks to Betty though, almost every day. They go on walks together, talk, gossip.

Betty is from China, first generation. She's nice, but you never talk politics with her or Lawrence. You don't envy Juliann. Sometimes Betty tries to complain to her about crime and black people and how black people do lots of crime.

You might have your own hangups about your parents, but at least they don't do that.

Betty and Lawrence assumed that most people coming to their front door were soliciters, and they hated soliciters. So, when you were going to visit Juliann, you'd go around the side and through their backyard.

It wasn't a huge, but it was large enough to house a substantial garden. Betty worked hard on it. She grew up on a farm, when she was young. One time there was a chicken wandering around (one of the neighbors a couple of blocks away kept chickens) and you and Juliann were at a loss. Betty came out, walked up behind the chicken, then darted forward and scooped it up, completely unphased by its frantic wriggling.

You were both very impressed. In retrospect, it wasn't that impressive, but it was a side of Betty that neither of you had really known about.

It's small, but cheery. Two bedrooms, one bathroom, a common area, a kitchen. Juliann had a roommate but you never met her. Or maybe you did? Well, if you did, she clearly didn't leave much of an impression.

There's a shoe rack near the door, as is traditional. The walls have a combination of movie posters (mostly obscure science fiction stuff that you're not super familiar with) and colorful cloth hangings. There's a map of Middle Earth hanging over the table, covered by a bright tablecloth. Even the laptop looks happy to be there. It's all clean. Cheery. Normal.

You shared it with Vincent until you left for college. Well, that's not quite accurate. You shared it with Vincent until you moved onto the couch, and stayed on the couch until you left for college. But you spent the majority of your childhood sleeping in this room.

In retrospect, it seems kind of strange that your parents had their daughter and son share a room into their teenage years. The house wasn't wanting for rooms. On the other hand, you and Vincent never came into conflict. They probably didn't want to incite a tantrum.

This was the TV room, with the one TV in the house, where Mom watched her Chinese action movies and Dad watched his basketball games. You and your brother played video games and watched anime.

For a while you slept the on couches instead of your bed, by your own choice. You don't remember why. You mostly remember rage, mixed with depression. Maybe depression, mixed with rage. Who knows?

Sometimes you'd play video games, deep in the night, when your parents were asleep and couldn't chastise you. You thought they didn't know. Of course they knew. They were just tired of fighting with you.

This was your favorite bathroom when you were growing up (the house had three). The shower was nice and hot, there was plenty of countertop near the sink, and the mirror was huge and pristine.

You spent a troubling amount of time here. It was the most comfortable room in the house. Nobody bothers you when you're in the bathroom.

  A car roars by, headlights cutting through the night, revealing tall trees and worn asphalt. Then it's gone, and you're left alone with the stars and moon. You can't even see your hands. Is this what it's like go camping? How do people even walk? You can't even see your feet! Navigating by the moon is bullshit, who the fuck wrote those stories? Panic starts to set in. You can't see, you don't know where you are, if you get lost in the woods nobody will ever find your body, maybe, just maybe you could turn back but -

  No, wait. You fish about in your pocket and pull out your phone. Right. You pull up your flashlight app and cast it about, revealing a 4-way intersection.
<<else>>\
  You pull out your phone, turn on the flashlight app. A 4-way intersection, no stop signs, tall trees all around.

You pull out your phone, turn on the flashlight app. A 4-way intersection, no stop signs, tall trees all around, and in the center of the intersection stands ET, from Steven Spielberg's famous movie, E.T. the Extra-terrestrial, a movie which you have never watched.

Come to think of it, there are probably a lot of kids nowadays who've never even heard of ET. That's how it goes, huh?

Did you really look like that, back then? Or is that what you think you would have looked like, if you could remember? You don't know. You screamed at your parents whenever they took your picture. The only ones you have are family photos, taken with your extended family. Of course you didn't scream then. That would have been disgraceful.

But you never looked at those photos.

Your friends had photos of their family and extended family on display in places of honor, full of smiling kids and proud parents. Your parents never put any of your photos up in your house. They knew you'd throw a tantrum if they did.

Did you really look like that? With all that time you spent staring into the mirror, you'd think you could remember. What's staring back at you is grotesque and bloated, all flabby and fat and dull eyes, but you do remember your weight, for each and every year since middle school.

Obsessive? Yes. But numbers are numbers, and you didn't weigh enough to look like <em>that.</em>

<h2 class='passage-header'>The Shower</h2>\
Spacious. Nice. Clean. Just how you remember it.

For a while, the plumbing was kind of broken and it would never go below a certain heat.

The heat was fine by you. You liked hot showers. The dermatologist said you shouldn't take hot showers, and you shouldn't take long showers, but you defied both commandments.

Your skin hated you. You went through so much moisturizing cream. The shower's weren't the only reason, of course, but they contributed.

<h2 class='passage-header'>Always Spotless</h2>\
Everybody in the house was very clean, that Mom made sure of. Of the three bathrooms in the house, this toilet was the largest and sturdiest. The one in the down downstairs bathroom was functional, but seemed old and rickety, and the one on the top floor was for your parents.

<h2 class='passage-header'>Like Clockwork</h2>\
Mom would empty every trash bin in the house every night. She washed dishes, did laundry, and cleaned the house like it was her job. Well, you suppose it was, to her.

You appreciate it, now. Time helped. But you will never tell her that.
<<include [[MIDDLE_BATHROOM_BUTTONS]]>>


:: MBR_SHOWER_2 {"position":"725,1050","size":"100,100"}
<h2 class='passage-header'>Safe Haven</h2>\
You turn the heat to its highest. You take a towel from the towel cabinet and lay it down on the floor. Your clothes go on the counter.

You sit on the floor and listen to the shower.

You wonder what your parents thought of you hour-long showers. Did they think that you were showering the whole time?

Of course, you knew you were wasting water.

Steam fills the room. You pull your knees up to your chest, close your eyes, time vanishes in a cloud of warmth.

:: MBR_SHOWER_3 {"position":"725,1150","size":"100,100"}
<h2 class='passage-header'>Shower Thoughts</h2>\
You take a towel from the cabinet and hang it on the hook. You step in, pull the curtains behind you.

The water is hot, almost too hot. Certainly too hot to be healthy. You take the soap (special soap, soft on the skin, as recommended by the dermatologist) and rub your arms. Little flakes of white detritus slough off your disgusting body. You'll have to cover yourself in cream when you get out. You leave the heat be.

The shampoo is special, too; anti-dandruff. You rub it in, wash your hands near the showerhead. You would gouge your scalp with your nails when you were young, so your parents shaved your head, in hopes that it would help. When you went to school that day you felt like a freak.

Thank fuck for dermatologists.

You wash out the shampoo, rub in some conditioner.

If you ever had to do chemo, well, wouldn't that be funny? May as well just go jump off a bridge.

That's an intrusive thought. Stop that. And it's wrong to think less of somebody just because they don't have hair. Even if it might be the only part of your body that you're proud of.

Fuck. Fuck! What the fuck is self-image, anyways?

You rinse out your hair. You close your eyes. You let the water wash all your worries away.

<h2 class='passage-header'>Bizarre, Really</h2>\
Mom and Dad never commented on your showers.

That's weird, right? That's weird. If I had a kid and they were spending two hours running the shower, I'd - I'd be worried, at least. Right?

They probably noticed. They probably just didn't want to argue about it.

No. That's a lie.

Nobody ever asked you why you were scared of spiders. Why would they? Girls are scared of spiders. Everybody knows that.

Who knows. Maybe that's just how it is. Maybe you'd just have ended up scared of spiders anyways. If you did, hopefully it would be in a less traumatic fashion.

You had a roommate who would trap them in a cup and dump them outside. First you thought she was brave, but then you realized that it's only brave if you're afraid.

The third year. First it was intermittent. Then you did it more, and at some point you simply abandoned your bed, migrating your blankets permanently into the down-downstairs. When you parents asked you what you were doing, you yelled at them. When they asked you why they were doing it, you yelled at them some more.

You don't remember what you yelled. You only remember what you felt when you yelled it.

For several years, before he became so infirm he had to go to an assisted living facility, Grandpa was living in the house with you. The guest bedroom is behind the TV room, and he'd often retire when he saw you getting ready for bed. You felt a sort of shame and anger every time he walked into his room, not at him, but at yourself, for failing so badly at being normal that you couldn't even sleep in your own bed.

God. What were you thinking? Surely there was some rationale. Yet all you can recall is rage and resentment and a creeping terror that you thought you'd left behind.

Forget about it, all right? You were depressed. You can't logic your way through depression.

You never learned how to find one. They didn't teach you that in college. You got a few interviews, but they went poorly.

You can't blame the interviewers. At best, you were low in self-confidence. At worst, you were neurotic and self-flagellating. You wouldn't have hired yourself either.

God! You could have at least hidden it for a few hours. No. No, you really couldn't.

So you stewed and rotted and that feeling of failure grew from a seed to a wonderful garden, and the more you felt it the worse you did. The longer you took to find a job, the worse it looked to employers. Eventually, they started asking it about. Eventually, you gave up, resigned yourself to an eternity of wasted days and shameful nights, a shadow in the corners of your parents' house.

You got your first job through nepotism, actually. One of Dad's friends. It worked. Your Dad may have given you hopelessly outdated advice in the job hunt, but he was right about one thing. Once you have a job, it's a lot easier to get the next one. You've had three, now, and every time you change jobs it almost breaks you.

Some of your friends have quit their jobs without another one lined up. You would never do that. That creeping shame is always there, lurking, waiting, ready to strike.

Come on. Nobody uses VCR players anymore. When was the last time you used a VCR? Cesario, in college?

Cesario. You haven't though of him in forever. In hindsight he was obviously trying to date you, but at the time you literally could not conceive of the possibility.

You went to the Palace of Legion of honor together on a weekend. You met his parents. You brought him back to your house. You were a little spiteful about it. Look, Mom! Look, Dad! I <em>can</em> make friends! What in the world. What were you doing.

When he was staying over the two of went rented a movie together. <em>Perfect Blue.</em> It was a weird choice for a date, but you were a weird kid, and you didn't think it was a date. In your defense, he was also into anime.

Eventually, he gave up. You don't know what happened to him. You feel sorry for him, now. I'm sorry, Cesario! It wasn't you, it was my crippling lack of self-esteem!

Years later, something clicked, and you suddenly realized what had happened. When that happened, you had felt almost transcendetly happy. Suddenly, you believed yourself worthy of love.

For a most of elementary school and the early years of middle school you'd come home and play games with Vincent, before he started making his own friends. Most of the games you played by taking turns. You had a promise that neither of you would play through any of the stories without the other. Grinding was fine, random exploration was fine, but for any story content you had to have your sibling. If your sibling wasn't there, you played something else.

Sometimes you'd play competitive games. He loved Armored Core. He beat you all the time, despite the fact that you were three years older. He learned faster. He reacted faster. And he practiced.

He was a lot better than you at video games. In a lot of other ways, too. You wish you saw him more.

You turned the sound off, so your parents wouldn't wake up, and played straight until dawn. You don't remember what happened on the next day, but it can't have been pleasant, for you or anybody around you.

You were obsessed with Final Fantasy X. It feels nostalgic and safe and inspirational all at once, even when you think about it now. Maybe that's why such an obviously miserable memory feels nostalgic to you.

Vincent restarted the game and played back up to the fight, and it froze again.

Eventually you reasoned that the disk must be broken. So, that was the only game the two of you bought for the Playstation 2 that you didn't finish. You suppose when you're a kid with more time than income, you'll finish anything you can get your hands on.

You played it some, but it started to stress you out, after a while. The gyroids were a little creepy, but that wasn't it. It was the way the clock ticked on, inevitably. One time you didn't play for a couple of weeks - not sure why, maybe your parents had shipped you off to summer camp or dragged you on a vacation - and when you logged back in, the game called you out for ignoring it.

That's your main memory of the game. Shame, at failing the fictional characters, and anger, because that was a cheap trick, game, what the fuck are you doing, and then that anger turned inwards and you berated yourself for falling for such a cheap trick. You took the disk and hid it at the back of the cabinet.

When Vincent asked you where the disk was you lied. Said you didn't know. He searched for a while then shrugged. You're not sure if he believed you, but if he didn't he never called you on it.

All the titles are disorganized, cases from one series mixed semi-randomly, some cases vertical, others horizontal. And there's manga mixed in, with no discernable pattern.

You don't know if you'd call them classics. That implies a level of distinction and cultural acknowledgement that the <em>X</em> TV series might not have achieved, despite its very pretty cast. <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> has a better chance. You were a pretty big CLAMP fan (and still are) - an all-woman circle? Cool then, cool now. You even hunted down English copies of <em>RG Veda,</em> which was extemely pretty despite being their first work. There's <em>Evangelion</em> there, and if that isn't classic you don't know what is. Ah! Here's that set of bootleg <em>Zeta Gundam</em> DVDs that you bought off the internet on the casual mention of classmates (you weren't even friends), subtitled by some enterprising souls with an uncertain grasp on either Japanese, English, or both.

Really, should have hunted down some fansubs on that one.

This section seems to be all manga. <em>Fruits Basket, X/1999, Bleach, Copernicus' Breath, A Bride's Story</em> - hang on. You stored your manga in the upstairs shelves. And <em>Copernicus' Breath</em> is...not something that ever got an English publication.

Also you're clinically depressed, go get a diagnosis! And sleep more! Try out rock climbing, you'll like it in the future!"

When he got into Stanford you burst with pride. Strange, isn't it? When you attended his graduation you think you cried. Go, Vincent! Go, live a happy life! Go make a lot of money, get married, have kids (or not, if you decide otherwise)!

Juliann's mom was always complaining. Oh, she say to the other parents, Juliann, she's so lazy, she's always gossiping instead of studying! Then Steven's mom would say something like, You should see my son! He spends so much time playing games! Your daughter plays the piano so well! and Betty would say No, no, Steven is such a good son, he listens to his parents, unlike my lazy daughter! and then Andrew's mom would chime in and...

You asked Mom about this. Why she always complained about Vincent, but hardly mentioned you. Why Betty always complained about Juliann. Weren't they happy? Juliann did everything Betty asked. Lawrence was such a good son.

Did you ask her, or did you accuse her? It was so long ago.

She owned a computer repair shop. She knew almost nothing about computers themselves. She didn't need to; that was what the employees were for. What she knew was how to manage people and money.

From what you heard, she was tightfisted, but she never pretended she knew more than she did. Her employees seemed to respect her, from the times you hung around the shop, but that might have been because you only visited with Juliann. Maybe they just knew not to insult the owner in the hearing of her daughter.

Betty invested into land. Around here, that was a good investment. She has a lot more money than you'd think, looking at her house and furniture.

There was one time Mom and Betty went out to eat. Mom got the tab. You all happened to be at Betty's house. It came up. As is the Chinese way, they argued bitterly. It's no big deal! Oh, no, no, just take the money. No, really! You don't need to. No, I owe you, take it!

Baking is her thing, but she's also a great cook. She cooked with her mom and she was good at it.

That was something you always felt mixed messages on. Mom and Betty put a lot of stock in being wives. Juliann tried to please Betty, and learned all the wifely skills. You, on the other hand, were both bad-tempered and very American. Is that how you should put it? You're not sure. Maybe that's just a thin ideological excuse for your fury. All you know is that you resented the expectation that you should know how to cook and acted accordingly, with screaming and tantrums.

That didn't stop you feeling ashamed, it just meant that Mom stopped trying to teach you.

Well, you regret that. Cooking is a vital life skill. Plus, screaming at Mom for trying to teach you is somewhere between ungrateful and cruel. Would've been better if you'd listened.

You don't remember exactly what you played. You're not a big fan of boardgames. She picked them up in college. Still, you came along.

Right. This is a dream. You can't die in a dream. Whatever happens...you can't die. You hold onto that thought.

Why this, dream? Your house has never burned down. You've never had to evacuate from a fire. You've never seen a volcano in person. So what is this a metaphor for? Or is it as empty as a scene in a movie that scared you when you were a child?

Also, dream, you have no idea what burning feels like. You've never really been burned. The worst you've had was a couple of minor oven accidents. Whatever that was, it hardly hurt. Burning alive probably hurts a lot more than that.

No, wait. This is a dream. It doesn't - you can't get sick from a dream.

You realize this is probably doing more harm then good, that sponging dirty water into a wound is the worst thing you could - wait, this is a dream, you can't get infected. Right? You shake your head and pull your arm out of the water.

Now they are red, all blood and flesh. You shudder, dip your arms into the marsh water, and around you a great red bloom grows. Your arms emerge clean, though soon the blood resumes its flow.

It doesn't matter. No more leeches latch on to you. The remainder of the barrier parts without incident. You wade over to the platform and pull yourself up.

You rise, slowly, and contemplate the doors. Three ways out. No, wait, there are four. When did the fourth arrive?

Doesn't matter. Four ways out.
